# What are the things that make a keyboard layout good?

1. Most common keys on the home row and don't require pinky
2. Bigrams mostly alternate hands, and use different fingers when not
4. Bigrams and common modifiers don't require "annoying" hand configurations or big stretches.
5. h, j, k, and l are somehow mnemonically arranged

Can we have all these constraints satisfied?

# Data

Letter frequency order:
etaoinsrhdlcumfpgwybvkxjqz

Letters frequently at the beginning of a word:
taoiswcb

Letters frequently at the end of a word:
esndtyrf

Bigram order:
th he in er an re on at en nd ti es or te of ed is it al ar st nt to

Bigrams common at the beginnings of words:
th of an in to co re be fo pr wh ha ma wi he is no wa on de st se as

Bigrams common at the ends of words:
he of ed nd on er ng to in es is re at as or al ly nt en an ts th le

Common modifiers:
Shift+anything Ctrl+C Cmd+C Cmd+V Cmd+Q Cmd+S Ctrl+A Cmd+F Cmd+N Ctrl+K Cmd+Shift+P Ctrl+R Ctrl+E Ctrl+W
(Shift is common for beginning things)

Common symbols (my best guess about my own typing patterns):
    space . , " ' ? ! ( ) : ; = / @ - # + $ * < > [ ] { } _ & ^ \ ~ | % `

(Golang):
    . ( ) , = / { } : " ' * [ ] + ; % ; % & !< - > _ | \ ? # ^

(Javascript):
    = ) ( . , ; / { } ' _ : * [ ] + - " $ ! & | ? ` < > % @ \ # ^ ~

(C++)
    _ / : ) ( , . > < - ; * = # { } & ! \ ~ " @ ' + | [ ] % $ ? ^ `

(Python)
    _ . ' ) ( , " = : # - > [ ] \ / % * < ` { } + @ ; | ? ! & ^ $ ~

(Haskell)
    \- . , ( ) > = : < $ " * ' [ ] _ | # { } + / \ ^ ! @ ~ & ; % ` ?

(all programming languages according to xahlee.info)
    _ ) ( . , ' = - / " ; * : > $ # { } < & \ [ ] @ | + ! % ? ` ~ ^


symbols common before words:
space " ' ( / @ [ {

symbols common after words:
space . , " ' ? ! ) : ; / ] }
